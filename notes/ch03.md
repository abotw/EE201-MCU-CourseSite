This chapter cover four main topics: Electromagnetic Interference and Decoupling Capacitors, Transistor Applications, the 74HC138 Decoder, and an LED Flashing Program.

## 3.1 Electromagnetic Interference and Decoupling Capacitor Application

- **Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC):** Defined as the ability of equipment to function normally in an electromagnetic environment without causing unacceptable electromagnetic disturbance to other devices 1.
- **Interference Examples:** Sources include lightning, pulse circuits, electrostatic discharge (ESD), wireless communication, DC motors, and inductive load switching 2.
- **Low-Frequency Filtering Capacitors:**
    - **Functions:** Provide a **buffering effect** (protects against current surge upon power-on) and a **stabilizing effect** (maintains voltage during operation and sudden power consumption changes) 3.
    - **Selection Principle:** The capacitor's rated voltage should be at least **two times** the system's operating voltage 4. Common types are aluminum electrolytic, tantalum, and ceramic capacitors 5.
- **High-Frequency Decoupling Capacitors (e.g., 104 Capacitor):**
    - **Value:** A 104 capacitor is equal to $0.1\mu\text{F}$ ($10 \times 10^4 \text{pF}$) 6.
    - **Layout Requirement:** They must be placed as close as possible to the IC power supply pins to maximize the filtering effect 7.

## 3.2 Transistor Application in Digital Circuits

- **Definition:** A transistor (triode) is a semiconductor device that provides **current amplification** 8. Its control principle is that the current between one pair of terminals (Collector-Emitter) is controlled by the current in the other terminal (Base) 9.
- **Classification:** Classified by material (Germanium/Silicon) and structure (PNP/NPN) 10.
- **Three States:**
    - **Cut-off State:** Base current ($I_b$) is $\approx 0$, so Collector current ($I_C$) is $\approx 0$. The transistor acts as an **open circuit** (OFF) 11.
    - **Saturation State:** Base current is large enough that the Collector current ($I_C$) reaches its maximum. The transistor acts as a **closed circuit/wire** (ON) 12.
    - **Application:** Digital circuits primarily utilize the **Cut-off** and **Saturation** states for switching 13.
- **Functions in Digital Circuits:**
    - **Voltage Conversion:** Can use a low control voltage (e.g., 5V from a microcontroller) to switch a high-voltage device (e.g., 12V) 14.
    - **Drive/Current Amplification:** Used to amplify the micro-ampere control signal from an I/O port into the milli-ampere drive current needed for devices like LEDs or buzzers, overcoming the limited output capacity of the microcontroller I/O port (e.g., STC89C52's output is only $250\mu\text{A}$) 15.

## 3.3 74HC138 Three-to-Eight Line Decoder Application

- **Function:** A logic device that uses 3 address inputs (A0, A1, A2) to select and activate one of its 8 output lines (Y0 to Y7) 16.
- **LED Driving Flow:** In a common configuration, the circuit uses a pull-up resistor where the output is initially high (LED off). The program controls the selected output pin to transition to a **low level** to successfully light up the LED (assuming an active-low LED connection) 17.
- **Addressing Example:** To select the Y5 output, the address inputs (A2, A1, A0) must be set to 101 (binary for 5) 18.

## 3.4 LED Flashing Program

- **Design Concept:** Achieved by implementing a cycle of **Turn On** (e.g., `LED = 0`), **Delay**, **Turn Off** (e.g., `LED = 1`), and **Delay** 19.
- **Delay Method:** A simple `for` loop is used in the example code to create a basic time delay 20.
